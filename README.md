Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks by Alex Rodriguez and Alessandro Laio (2014).

This package is implemented in R and investigated another option for the rho (local density) computation: mean distance to M nearest neighbors, where M is computed as some constant percentage of the number of samples N.
